**Aqua-G:** _A Universal Gesture Framework for developing gesture-enabled applications_

AQUA-G is a software framework for developing gesture-enabled applications.  I developed it to fulfill the requirements of my M.S. degree in Computer Engineering and Human Computer Interaction at Iowa State University.

AQUA-G is written in C++ and works on Windows and Linux.  Gestures and events are defined programmatically and are dynamically loaded by AQUA-G through shared libraries.  This means that to develop your own custom gestures, you won't have to touch the AQUA-G source code itself.
