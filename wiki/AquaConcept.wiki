#summary Concept of Aqua

==Concept==
Aqua is a universal input device and gesture handling system.  It has a unified event architecture that allows for a great deal of flexibility in gesture recognition algorithms, input devices, and client applications. 

Aqua is designed with developers in mind, and utilizes shared libraries to dynamically load gestures and events.  Developers can easily add new events and gestures to the system, because it is not necessary to recompile the entire system to add a new event, gesture, or input device.

Since Aqua is designed to be compatible with as many input devices and programming languages is possible, communication to Aqua is performed through TCP sockets. Aqua will be compatible with Windows, Linux and MAC OS, though currently I'm just working on the Windows version.

==Why should you use Aqua?==
First of all, don't get too excited.  It isn't finished yet.  But here's a preview:

Aqua will be open source software (LGPL), so you are free to modify the code as you choose.  Additionally, Aqua will be compatible with a variety of input devices.  Ideally, as the project grows, the community will contribute input device drivers for Aqua, increasing the probability that your input device will work with Aqua out-of-the-box.  Examples include multitouch screens, mice & keyboard input, 3D time-of-flight cameras, Wiimotes, game controllers, etc.

Aqua allows for the possibility of multi-modal gestural interaction, because you may connect more than one input device at the same time.  Tangible UIs will also fit nicely into this architecture.  Aqua also allows multiple simultaneous users, each with his or her own set of input devices.

Because Aqua has a unified event architecture, many gestures will work with a variety of input devices out-of-the-box.  You configure your input device to provide the appropriate events for the gestures you desire to receive, and you will instantly receive gesture events.

Finally, Aqua is designed to allow for easy integration of existing gesture recognition algorithms.  I hope that developers will contribute many and varied forms of gesture recognition that are already available, increasing the usefulness of Aqua to software developers wishing to easily integrate gestural interaction into their new or existing software applications.
